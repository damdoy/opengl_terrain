# Procedural terrain generation (Work in progress)

The goal of this project is to mix the examples done here : https://github.com/damdoy/opengl_examples
into a big hilly terrain.

#### Features:
- dynamic LOD terrain (on cpu)
- dynamic grass
- shadow mapping
- dynamic sky
- phong lighting model
- water reflection
- trees
- shadow mapping

Everything is procedurally generated

## how to build
Create a `build` folder and call `cmake ..` inside it, then `make`
